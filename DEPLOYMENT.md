# How I'll Deploy My Site

## What I Need to Buy

1. **Domain Name** - from Namecheap (~$10-15/year)
2. **VPS Hosting** - from Namecheap (~$10-15/month)
   - NOT shared hosting (doesn't support Django)
   - VPS gives me full control to install Python, Django, etc.

## What I'll Get

- **Full server control** - install whatever I need
- **Python support** - run my Django backend
- **Node.js support** - run my Next.js frontend
- **Database** - MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **SSL certificate** - secure my site
- **Email hosting** - professional email addresses

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Buy Hosting & Domain
- Get VPS hosting from Namecheap
- Buy domain from Namecheap (same account)
- Get server access details

### 2. Set Up Server
- Install Python and Django
- Install Node.js and Next.js
- Install database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Configure web server (Nginx)

### 3. Upload My Code
- **Frontend**: Build Next.js and upload
- **Backend**: Upload Django code
- **Database**: Set up and migrate data

### 4. Configure Domain
- Point domain to my server
- Set up SSL certificate
- Test everything works

## What Will Change

- **Database**: Switch from SQLite to MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Environment**: Change from local to production
- **URLs**: Update API endpoints to production domain
- **Images**: Store in production media folder

## What Stays the Same

- All my code works exactly the same
- All features work the same
- All styling and design stays the same
- All functionality stays the same

## After Deployment

- My site will be live at my domain
- Customers can visit and shop
- I can manage products through Django admin
- I can update code anytime by uploading new files

## Notes for Me

- VPS hosting is more expensive but gives me full control
- I can always upgrade or downgrade hosting as needed
- Everything will work the same as it does locally
- I can manage everything from one hosting account
